To handle this duplication unordered_multiset should be used, it can store duplicate elements also.
 Internally when an existing value is inserted, the data structure increases its count which is associated with each value.
 As count of each value is stored in unordered_multiset, it takes more space than unordered_set (if all values are distinct)*****
 
 The internal implementation of unordered_multiset is same as that of unordered_set and also uses hash table for searching, just the count value is associated with each value in former one
 
 
 
 
 ********unordered_multimap*****
 unordered_multimap in STL are associative containers like unordered maps where each element consists of a key value and a mapped value, the only difference is unordered multimaps can store duplicate elements
