1. An unordered_set is implemented using a hash table where keys are hashed into indices of a hash table so that the insertion is always randomized.
2. The unordered_set can contain key of any type â€“ predefined or user-defined data structure but when we define the key of type user define the type, 
   we need to specify our comparison function according to which keys will be compared.
3. An unordered set in STL is a container that stores unique elements in no particular order.
4. Every operation on an unordered set takes O(1) complexity in the average case and takes O(n) in the worst case.
